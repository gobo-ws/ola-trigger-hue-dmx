OLA Trigger config to control Philips Hue lights and Osram Lightify products with DMX (ArtNet, SACN or via DMX input)

Osram Lightify products works when connected to a Philips Hue bridge.

Should also work with any other Zigbee Light Link (ZLL) product that can be connected to a Philips Hue bridge.
For instance Cree LED Connected, GE Link lamps and the new smart lighting products (TRÃ…DFRI, JORMLIEN, SURTE & FLOALT) from IKEA.

There is only one lamp and one Lightify plug in this simple example but you can easy add more.
The Hue bridge has some frame rate limits and I haven't checked the performance with more then one lamp.

Other things that can be added to this config is support for groups, color settings for other Hue devices and so on.
