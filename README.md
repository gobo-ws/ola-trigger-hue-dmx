OLA Trigger config to control Philips Hue lights and Osram Lightify products with DMX.

Osram Lightify products works when connected to a Philips Hue bridge.

Should also work with any other Zigbee Light Link (ZLL) product that can be connected to a Philips Hue bridge.
For instance Cree LED Connected and GE Link lamps.

According to the dutch site Tweakers, the new reasonably priced smart lighting products from IKEA would also use Zigbee Light Link for communication.

There is only one lamp and one Lightify plug in this simple example but you can easy add more.
The Hue bridge has some frame rate limits and I haven't checked the performance with more then one lamp.

Other things that can be added to this config is support for groups, color settings for other Hue devices and so on.
