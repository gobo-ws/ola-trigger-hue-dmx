OLA Trigger config to control Philips Hue lights and Osram Lightify products with DMX.
Osram Lightify products works when connected to a Philips Hue bridge.

There is only one lamp and one Lightify plug in this simple example but you can easy add more.
The Hue bridge has some frame rate limits and I haven't checked the performance with more then one lamp.

Other things that can be added to this config is support for groups, color settings for other Hue devices and so on.
