OLA Trigger config to control Philips Hue Lux lights with DMX.

There is only one lamp in this simple example but you can easy add more.
The Hue bridge has some frame rate limits and I haven't checked the performance with more then one lamp.

Other things that can be added to this config is support for groups, color settings for other Hue devices and so on.
